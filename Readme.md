# Web Resume - In React
I remade my resume in React because, well, why not?

You can look at it in the **[Demo Page](https://spaghetticoder101.github.io/web-resume/)**

## No really, why?
TL;DR: My GitHub profile was pathetically empty, but there comes a time in a developer's life when you actually need to showcase some work. I had an idea for a nice little project that also involves displaying my resume. This meant that I actually had to build my resume, and here we are.


## Techstack
The project is built using **Vite**, **React.js** and **Typescript**, I also used some packages: 
- **Jotai**: For state management, used for the localization
- **Stitches**: for CSS-in-JS
- **Nivo**: for the bar chart
- **Framer Motion**: for the animations


## Installation and Setup
To run the application locally:

```
1 Clone the repository.

2 Navigate to the project directory.

3 Run npm install to install dependencies.

4 Run npm start to start the local development server.

5 The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:5173/.
```


## Future Plans
I plan on keeping this project alive, adding stuff from time to time, and exploring ways to make viewing a resume a more enjoyable experience.
